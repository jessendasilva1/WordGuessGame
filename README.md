# WordGuessGame

## Description
This Hockey themed Hangman style game allows you to guess various popular words and phrases from the game we all know and love. 
They could be people, places, things, phrases or sayings and you must guess then within the maximum allowed number of guesses. 

## How to play
    1. Start off by pressing a key on your keyboard
        - It will either be a correct letter and it will reveal a letter in the hidden word
        - It will be a wrong guess and your remaining guess count goes down and the letter is placed in previous guesses. 
    
    2. If you guess the word in the allowed number of guesses you win!

    3. If you run out of guesses, you will loose the game and the game will automatically restart with a new hidden word.
